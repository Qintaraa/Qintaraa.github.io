##### I've been mainly interested in **blue team** and also **red team** for about 2 years now. I love combat sports and hiking in the mountains.

##### Iâ€™m proud to have earned several key certifications, including HTB Certified Digital Security Analyst (CDSA), BTL1, CompTIA Security+, as well as various Microsoft certifications.

##### These certifications have not only strengthened my theoretical understanding of cybersecurity but have also allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. One of the highlights of my journey has been participating in multiple Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. These CTFs offered me the chance to solve complex challenges and collaborate with a diverse range of security professionals, further refining my problem-solving and technical abilities.
